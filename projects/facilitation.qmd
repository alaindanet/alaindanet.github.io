community structure and ecosystem functioning"

Positive interactions, such as facilitation, have been greatly overlooked in
ecology despite being ubiquitous across taxa (from bacteria to plants and
vertebrates) and ecosystem types (terrestrial and aquatic). Species that create
those positive interactions often do so by improving local environmental
conditions, which often make them keystone or engineer species. The research
interest around those positive interactions have lagged behind because,
historically, competition and predation have been thought to be the main types
of species interactions structuring communities and determining ecosystem
functioning. During my PhD, I studied the effects of facilitation among plants
on community assembly and ecosystem functioning through the lens of modern
ecological theory, with experimental and theoretical approaches.

# Facilitation effects on functional trait distribution

Nurse plants that have protection against grazing, for example by bearing
thorns, often extend their protection to species growing in their vicinity or
below their canopy (Anthelme & Michalet, 2009; Smit et al., 2007). This is the
case of cushion plants found in the Cordillera Real of Bolivia, which provide
forage for traditional livestock grazing by llamas and alpacas. With Fabien
Anthelme and Rosa Isela Menenes from Herbario Nacional de Bolivia (La Paz,
Bolivia), I have set up two field expeditions to collect in situ leaf traits and
vegetation cover in a grazing exclusion experiment at 4500 m altitude near
Titicaca lake. I used these data to show that facilitation against grazing
(provided by the nurse plants) modifies the selective pressures on plant
communities, which further determines the distribution of their functional
traits. In particular, facilitated communities (i.e. those benefiting from
grazing protection by a nurse) display more even distribution of functional
traits (less dominance), and less trait overlap between species (more niche
differentiation, Danet et al., 2017, 2018).

Our empirical results indicated that facilitation against grazing can enhance species coexistence by
allowing non-grazing resistant phenotypes to persist in the community. I confirmed this intuition
by developing a spatially-explicit theoretical model in collaboration with Florian Schneider and
Sonia KÃ©fi, to show that this positive effect of protection against grazing by nurse plants generate
stable coexistence between nurse and facilitated species over a large combination of environmental
harshness and grazing pressure (Danet et al., 2020), making this type of interactions
potentially relevant outside of arid or alpine systems.

# Facilitation effects on ecosystem functioning and stability

Nurse plants can enhance environmental conditions and thus maintain higher biodiversity and
biomass production in harsh environments, but the mechanisms behind this pattern have not been
tested. In collaboration with Susana Bautista (University of Alicante), I set up an in situ experiment in
Southeastern Spain, where I assembled 320 sapling communities with two levels of species richness
(one or three species per community), in open space or under the canopy of a nurse plant, and
manipulated water stress. We tracked the survival, biomass and measured in situ the leaf traits of the
sapling communities over a year.

We found that facilitation occurred, but only for species-diverse communities in drought conditions,
which produced more biomass mainly thanks to higher complementarity (Danet et al., 2024).
Facilitation was revealed by showing that plants located under the canopy of a nurse had a functional
trait profile typical of lower water stress (lower Leaf Dry Matter Content, higher Specific Leaf Area).
Nurse plants were also found to modify the competitive hierarchy among species,
as measured by selection effects, such that species that
were the least competitive benefited
the most from facilitation.

Those results suggest that nurse plants are crucial in maintaining species diversity and
ecosystem functioning in harsh environments. These insights were tested in a theoretical model,
which highlighted that nurse plants can reduce the likelihood of irreversible desertification in drylands
(Danet et al., 2020).
