Understanding the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is essential to provide
evidence-based policy to conserve and manage ecosystems. Previous research showed that species
richness increases community biomass by increasing niche complementarity, and increases
community stability mostly by increasing asynchrony in species fluctuations (Thibaut & Connolly,
2013; Tilman et al., 2006). Temporal community stability is often measured as the inverse of the
coefficient of variation of biomass/abundance, which can be partitioned into species stability and
asynchrony (Thibaut & Connolly, 2013; Zhao et al., 2022). Most of our knowledge on ecosystem
functioning is based on a restricted set of organisms, namely plant assemblages, which poorly
reflect the complexity of natural communities as they do not include primary and secondary
consumers. I have focused on extending our knowledge of the link between biodiversity and
ecosystem functioning to more complex communities, i.e. food webs, using empirical and
theoretical approaches during two of my post-docs, one at MNHN (Paris, 2018-2021) with Colin
Fontaine, Maud Mouchet, and Élisa Thébault, and one ongoing at Sheffield (UK, 2022-now) with
Andrew Beckerman.

# Effect of species richness and food web structure on temporal stability

Using inferred riverine food webs as described in the previous part, we showed
that both species richness and food web structure determine average total
biomass and its temporal stability (Danet et al., 2021). Both fish species
richness and average trophic level increased total biomass. We further found
that higher average trophic level increased community stability by increasing
population stability (i.e. amplitude of species oscillations, Figure 5). And as
found previously in simpler species assemblages, species richness was increasing
asynchrony in species fluctuations, thereby increasing community stability. In
contrast, we found that fish populations were more synchronous than found in
previous studies considering simpler species assemblages. We further found that
species pairs linked by trophic interactions were more synchrone than species
pairs not involved in trophic interactions. We hypothesised multi-trophic
communities are characterised by lower asynchrony than simpler species
assemblages, because the presence of generalist predators can synchronise the
dynamics of their prey. It was difficult to go further in the interpretation
because of the lack of other studies to compare my results with. Identifying
this key role of generalist predators has strong implications in the current
context of generalist, non-native species colonising many ecosystems. Community
changes toward more generalist species could trigger a decrease in the diversity
of species response to environmental perturbations, i.e. a decrease in response
diversity. But it is the diversity of species responses to environmental
perturbations that generates asynchrony in species fluctuations and then drives
the positive relationship between community stability and species richness.
Hence, I was really interested in investigating the effects of the diversity of
species response to environmental fluctuations and species richness on temporal
stability of complex food webs. I further delved into these questions during my
postdoc at the University of Sheffield. My goal was to bring stability-species
richness theory and food web theory together, as species interactions (e.g.
consumer-resource oscillations) can generate asynchrony on top of response
diversity.

# Theoretical models

![](smallmodule_stoc_model.png)

To answer that question, I developed a theoretical model describing the dynamic
of species in complex food webs facing environmental stochasticity in their
mortality rates. This has been possible through the contribution to the
development of a Julia package that facilitates the simulation of such complex
communities (EcologicalNetworksDynamics.jl), which I did under the lead with
researchers at ISEM (Montpellier) and in particular Ismaël Lajaaiti, Iago
Bonnici and Sonia Kéfi (Lajaaiti et al., 2024). My model includes response
diversity of species to environmental stochasticity, i.e. the ability of species
to respond differently to the same environmental change, the crucial mechanism
that generates asynchrony in species fluctuations and then positive
stability-species richness relationships. We found that response diversity and species richness
jointly increase asynchrony also in complex food webs.
food web structural properties, such as average trophic level, connectance (a
measure of complexity), and average interaction strength, all decrease
asynchrony. We further found, as in empirical data (Danet et al., 2021), that
increasing average trophic level increases population stability. Overall, we
also found positive community stability - species richness relationships, but
only when response diversity was high. High response diversity was indeed
increasing asynchrony. However, high number of species interactions (i.e. higher
connectance) and high average trophic level were resulting in negative
stability-richness relationships, because they were dampening asynchrony (Figure
6, bottom panel). This study thus confirmed our initial hypothesis drawn from
empirical fish communities (Danet et al., 2021), namely that trophic interaction
can limit asynchrony among species. Then, our research showed that response
diversity and species richness increase community stability in complex food webs
as in plant communities, but that it depends on food web structure. In turn, we
also showed that a decrease in species response diversity and changes in
food web structure could lead to a decrease in the stability of ecological
communities (Danet et al., in prep for Nature Ecology & Evolution).
