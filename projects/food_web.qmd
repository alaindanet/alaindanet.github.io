stability of ecological communities"

How biodiversity determines temporal stability is a central question in
ecology. This question has been adressed quite a lot in grasslands and other
species assemblages. However, the effects of food-web have been overlooked.

Trophic interactions, by their effects of biomass fluxes, can have tremendous
effects on community stability. For example, generalist predators can stabilise
their preys.
