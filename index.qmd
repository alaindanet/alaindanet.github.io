:::{#hero-heading}

I work as an INRAE researcher in [DECOD lab](https://www.umr-decod.fr/en) at Rennes in France.

My research aims to understand how anthropogenic pressures alter ecological
communities and ultimately disrupt ecosystem functioning. This is a complex
challenge because community responses emerge from both the diversity of
species-specific reactions to environmental changes and the intricate networks
of interactions among species. My work integrates these interaction networks
into theoretical and applied ecology to address a central question: How do
species interactions mediate the effects of environmental pressures on
ecological systemsâ€”particularly in community assembly, ecosystem functioning,
and stability?

You can have a look at my [research projects](project.html) and my
[publications](publications.html). You can also retrieve my work on [google
