:::{#hero-heading}


I am currently in post-doc at the University of Sheffield (UK) in [Pr Andrew
Beckerman's lab](https://beckslab.github.io/website/). I am mainly working on
how food web structure affect community stability and affect their response to
environmental pressures. My research interests also cover biodiversity
trends and positive interactions among species.

You can have a look at my [research projects](project.html) and my
[publications](publications.html). You can retrieve my work on [google
scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iijI6msAAAAJ&hl=en) and
[research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alain-Danet).
