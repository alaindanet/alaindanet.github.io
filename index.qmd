**Food-webs :: Stability :: Positive interactions**

I am currently in post-doc at the University of Sheffield (UK) in [Pr Andrew
Beckerman's lab](https://andbeck.github.io/beckslab/). I am mainly working on how food web structure affect community
stability and affect their response to environmental pressures. I also work my
research interests cover biodiversity trends and positive interactions among
species.
